This wonderful piece of code allows you to create a magnifying glass on a map !
In this magnifying glass you can have several layer and you will see them alternatively thanks to a shift of opacity.

The magnifying glass is based on the code of Jean-Marc VIGLINO.

The shifting of opacity between layers was made for a small project.
